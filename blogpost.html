            communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or felt to others. But speech
            limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of
            communication across space and time. We use Cookies on this site to enhance your experience and improve our marketing efforts. Click on Privacy Notice to learn more. By continuing to browse without changing your browser settings to block or
